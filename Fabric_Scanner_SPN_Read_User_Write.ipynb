    "1. **Service Principal Setup** (for Scanner API reads):\n",
    "   - Create App Registration in Azure AD\n",
    "   - Add API permissions: Power BI Service → `Tenant.Read.All`, `Workspace.Read.All`\n",
    "   - Enable in Power BI Admin Portal → \"Allow service principals to use Fabric APIs\"\n",
    "   - Store credentials as environment variables:\n",
    "     - `FABRIC_SP_TENANT_ID`\n",
    "     - `FABRIC_SP_CLIENT_ID`\n",
    "     - `FABRIC_SP_CLIENT_SECRET`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Account** (for lakehouse writes):\n",
    "   - Must have Contributor or Admin role on the lakehouse\n",
    "   - Will be prompted for interactive login during notebook execution\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lakehouse Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Attach lakehouse to this notebook\n",
    "   - Note workspace ID and lakehouse ID for upload configuration"

    "\n",
    "✅ **Automated Scanning**: SPN allows unattended scheduled scans  \n",
    "✅ **User Accountability**: All data writes are tracked to individual users  \n",
    "✅ **Least Privilege**: SPN can have Viewer role (read-only), user has write permissions  \n",
    "✅ **Audit Trail**: User authentication provides clear audit log for data modifications  \n",
    "✅ **Separation of Duties**: Different credentials for read vs write operations  \n",

    "## Security Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Service Principal credentials should be stored in Azure Key Vault or Fabric secrets\n",
    "- User authentication uses standard Microsoft login flow (MFA supported)\n",
    "- Token caching minimizes login prompts during same session\n",
